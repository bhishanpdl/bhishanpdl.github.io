As a Physics Ph.D. graduate student at Ohio University I am enrolled in the
departmental astroseminar club. In this year of 2018 Spring Session the topic
of my talk was `HST and Spitzer Observations of the HD 207129 Debris Ring`. The presentation file can be found at `filles/astroseminar2018mar28.pdf`.
